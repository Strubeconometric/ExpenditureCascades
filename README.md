# ExpenditureCascades

To run this project do the following:

1. create a parent folder (name does not matter)
2. download all content into this folder
3. create three subfolders inside the parent folder: 
    "output",
    "data_raw", and
    "data_tidy"
4. move all csv.files into the data_raw folder
5. open the R file and make sure that the working directory/here/project file is located inside the parent folder
6. follow the instructions in the R script and run the code
7. check the output folder for regression tables in word format

This project is an extended replication of ‘Income Distribution and Aggregate Saving: A Non-Monotonic Relationship’ by Peter Bofinger and Philipp Scheuermeyer from 2019.

To test for the relative income hypothesis, the Gini coefficient was swapped out for the top 1% and top 10% income indicators. In line with the theory about expenditure cascades, the liberalization of financial markets was included as a control variable. In contrast to the reference paper by Bofinger and Scheuermeyer, this econometric analysis is based on the latest standardized world inequality database (SWIID9). These changes lead to highly significant results which confirm the relative income hypothesis for high income OECD countries.

This projected was created for a term paper at University of Duisburg-Essen to ensure scientific transparency criteria.
