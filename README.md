Panel Data Analysis of Income Inequality and Household Savings with R

This project is a extended replication of ‘Income Distribution and Aggregate Saving: A Non-Monotonic Relationship’ by Peter Bofinger and Philipp Scheuermeyer from 2019.

To test for the relative income hypothesis, the Gini coefficient was swapped out for top 1% and top 10% income indicators. In line with the theory about expenditure cascades, the liberalization of financial markets was included as a control variable. In contrast to the reference paper by Bofinger and Scheuermeyer, this econometric analysis is based on the latest standardized world inequality database (SWIID9). These changes lead to highly significant results which confirm the relative income hypothesis for high income OECD countries.

This projected was created for a term paper at University of Duisburg-Essen to insure scientific transparency criteria.
